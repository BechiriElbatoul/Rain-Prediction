# Kaggle Rain Prediction Challenge

## Overview
Rain prediction is a key area in meteorology that helps in agriculture, disaster management, and daily planning. Traditionally, weather forecasting relied on physical models of the atmosphere. However, machine learning (ML) is transforming this field by analyzing large datasets of historical weather patterns to make more accurate predictions.

ML models, like decision trees, neural networks, and ensemble methods, can uncover complex relationships between factors such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed, which traditional models might miss. By continuously learning from new data, ML improves the precision of rain forecasts, helping to mitigate risks related to weather conditions.

## Challenge Description
This challenge is a classification problem that aims to create models that can predict whether it will rain tomorrow based on the following features:
- **Date**
- **Location**
- **MinTemp**
- **MaxTemp**
- **Rainfall**
- **Evaporation**
- **Sunshine**
- **WindGustDir**
- **WindGustSpeed**
- **WindDir9am**
- **WindDir3pm**
- **WindSpeed9am**
- **WindSpeed3pm**
- **Humidity9am**
- **Humidity3pm**
- **Pressure9am**
- **Pressure3pm**
- **Cloud9am**
- **Cloud3pm**
- **Temp9am**
- **Temp3pm**
- **RainToday**

## Evaluation
Submissions are evaluated on the F1 score, which balances precision and recall. The F1 score is particularly useful for imbalanced classification problems, as it accounts for both false positives and false negatives.

## Dataset
- **Training Data**: Contains historical weather data along with the target variable `RainTomorrow`, indicating whether it rained the next day.
- **Test Data**: Contains weather data for which predictions need to be made.
